      <h1>Website Design</h1>
      <main>
        <p></p>
      	<p>While constructing my website, I made many choices that were influenced by existing websites that I thought had extremely
		successful designs. For example, I was inspired by Wikipedia’s simplicity and extremely convenient usability. In 
		addition, I was impressed with how clean and formal Apple’s website looks, so I attempted to replicate some of their 
		features in my design.</br></br>
		To begin with, Apple’s navigation bar draws attention to itself and is clearly labelled, so I also designed a 
	  	navigation bar that would improve the usability of my site for my users. Next, my website uses darker background 
	  	colors and an attention-grabbing header, similar to Apple’s website. Finally, I chose to use a picture on my homepage 
	 	to immediately engage my audience, just like Apple uses an image of their iPhone.</br></br>
		If I were to revise my design further based on this comparison with Apple’s website, I could add a larger variety of
	  	background colors to my homepage. Apple uses contrast between black and white to make their page even more intriguing 
	  	and I believe that I could be even more successful by doing so as well.</br></br<</p>
