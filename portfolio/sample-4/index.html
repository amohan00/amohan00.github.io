      	<p>My movie poster genre remix assignment is the perfect example of how I made a choice related to the genre and audience. 
	The original poster features dark and cold colors such as black and blue to convey feelings of horror. On the other 
	hand, my new romantic comedy poster uses lighter and warmer colors such as white, red, and pink. I also removed the 
	weapons from the original background and focused on the two characters’ faces. I anticipated my audience’s expectations
	in viewing a romantic comedy poster and attempted to meet those expectations with my work.</br></br>
	If I had to reimagine this work in another genre, I think I could successfully create a science fiction movie poster 
	using the original image. I could take advantage of the mysterious mood and the weapons in the original poster. My 
	user’s experience would drastically change from light-hearted and humorous to uneasy and intriguing. If I were to 
	revise my work even further for an expert on the topic, I would need to add extra details to my poster such as a 
	movie slogan, directors, producers, or actors to make the final product seem more genuine.</br></br<</p>
