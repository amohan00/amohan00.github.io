	<p>The third Audacity tutorial assignment, which focused on vocal removal and isolation, proved to be extremely challenging 
		for me. I tried completing the assignment using a variety of different songs and audio files and ended up spending 
		hours trying to create the perfect audio clip. Eventually, I conducted my own outside research as well and tried to 
		find tutorials and techniques to help me successfully remove the vocals from a song. Finally, I was able to remove 
		the vocals to What a Wonderful World by Louis Armstrong to the best of my ability. If I listen closely, I can still 
		hear some of Louis Armstrongâ€™s words in certain parts of the song, but I am still extremely proud of my effort and 
		the final product.</br></br>
		By facing this obstacle, I learned that even though I was familiar with Audacity, I still had much to learn. There 
	  	is always room to practice even if you are an expert at something. I also improved my skills considerably while 
	  	conducting outside research to help me with this assignment. I was able to put them to good use in the next Audacity 
	  	tutorial and my soundscape.</br></br></p>
