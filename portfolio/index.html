      <h1>Written Reflection</h1>
      <main>
        <p></p>
        <p>For my second work-in-progress submission, my main focus was on the various Photoshop assignments that I would be adding to 
           my website. I was also able to brush up on some of the last few details in my HTML and CSS to fully realize my design ideas. 
           In this reflective essay, I will be explaining the decisions I made in completing my website and my photo-editing 
           assignments, including which design principles I made use of.</br></br>
	         To begin with, the biggest change I made to my website was to turn the main menu into a more aesthetically pleasing and 
           fully functional navigation bar. My original design, which was the same as the submenu, felt too simple and did not draw as 
           much attention to the main menu as I would have wanted. As I mentioned in the last written reflection, I feel like simple 
           and effective site navigation is the best way to keep users on your website for longer, because people are more likely to 
           back out of the website if they are confused and need to do extra work to find their way around. So, I implemented what I 
           believe to be a more professional design and stayed true to my color scheme by using dark green and dark grey. I also 
           applied the design principle of constraint by using a different design for the active page in the main menu and removing 
           the link, creating a barrier for users and simplifying my menu even further.</br></br>
	         Another major change to my website was the addition of new pages to display my Photoshop assignments and Pecha Kucha 
           presentation. I was able to follow the same website layout on every page to stay consistent to my overall design and make 
           the overall site more aesthetically pleasing. For my advertisement and movie genre remix assignments, I wanted to display 
           my finished product alongside the original images to emphasize my work and the differences between both images. I 
           accomplished this by using tables without borders, so I was able to easily present them side-by-side, give each picture 
           its own heading, and control the spacing between each image. Finally, I added my Pecha Kucha PowerPoint presentation to 
           its own page on my website by uploading the presentation to Microsoft OneDrive online and creating an embed link in the 
           form of an iframe tag. Coincidentally, the color scheme of my Pecha Kucha presentation matched the design of my website, 
           so I believe this worked in my favor in creating the most cohesive website possible.</br></br>
	         Furthermore, I would like to describe my decision-making behind each of my photo-editing assignments. To begin with, for my 
           advertisement, I turned the product from Cole of California to the Tinder dating app. I chose this because I figured that 
           the two models are relevant in both scenarios, but rather than focusing on their clothes, I shifted the attention to their 
           smiles and facial expressions. I included Tinder’s logo and one of their popular slogans to help the user understand what I 
           am referring to. For example, the slogan states “Tinder is how people meet”, so I am implying that this man and woman met 
           each other through Tinder, and that they are happy as a result. Finally, I chose to keep all of my additions in grayscale 
           to match the rest of the content of the advertisement. If the original content is black and white and I added a bright red 
           Tinder logo, I would destroy the continuity and authenticity of my final product.</br></br>
		Secondly, for my movie genre remix, I turned <i>Freddy Vs. Jason</i>, a popular horror and slasher movie, into a romantic comedy 
	   titled <i>When Freddy Met Jason</i>. To begin with, I decided to keep just Freddy and Jason’s faces from the original movie poster 
           because I still wanted to highlight both characters on my new poster. I deleted the ominous black and smoky background and 
           both character’s weapons, as these features clearly indicate horror and violence. Instead, I changed the background to a 
           dull pink color to imply romance, and I added trees in the background because, after doing some research, I noticed that 
           trees and nature are a common, lighthearted theme often found on romantic comedy movie posters. Finally, I changed the movie 
           title because “vs.” implies conflict and violence, a theme I wanted to erase. I was also aiming to capitalize on the success 
	   of <i>When Harry met Sally</i>, an extremely popular romantic comedy movie. I believe I was able to effectively turn <i>Freddy Vs. 
	   Jason</i> into a romantic comedy movie poster using these strategies.</br></br>
	         Finally, my storyboard and logo/watermark assignments were more straightforward in their designs. I made the decision to 
           use greyscale for my storyboard because I wanted the scenes to feel more continuous and authentic. I decided to use pictures 
           from various different sources instead of drawing my own scenes, so I did not want their color schemes to stand out apart 
           from each other. Since I made the entire storyboard greyscale, I am hoping the audience is unable to tell that each scene 
           was drawn separately. On the other hand, I chose to use reds and yellows for my restaurant’s watermark because research 
           shows that these colors stimulate our hunger and appetite. For example, McDonalds, Wendy’s, Chili’s, Applebee’s, and many 
           other restaurants use red or yellow in their logos for this reason. I also employed a simple design to make my watermark 
           seem more authentic. By keeping the horror vaccui design principle in mind, I chose not to overcrowd my watermark and 
           confuse my audience. I believe these decisions allowed me to create the most effective and realistic watermark for my 
           restaurant.</br></br>
	         In conclusion, I believe that my website design has been fully realized, and I am proud of the work and effort I displayed 
           in my photo-editing assignments and on each page of my site.</br></br></p>
