      <h1>Written Reflection</h1>
      <main>
        <p></p>
        <p>At the time of the final submission in our Composing Digital Media course, my website design vision has been fully realized 
		and my creative work has been completed. I am extremely proud of my work and the amount of effort I put into creating, 
		revising, and editing my final product. In this reflective essay, I will be discussing the decisions that led me to 
		this point and the processes both I and my work underwent throughout the length of the course.</br></br>
	To begin with, revisions were a vital part of both our course and my creative process. We had many opportunities to improve 
	  	on our assignments and edit our website in class and on our own time, and I believe I took full advantage. In regard 
	  	to my website design, my strategy was similar to guessing and checking. I am constantly learning more about what HTML 
	  	and CSS have to offer, so the best way for me to decide which features to include was to implement them all. For 
	  	example, my navigation bar used to simply be just the example provided for us in class, but I was able to do my own 
	  	research and find various ways to improve its look and functionality. In order to pick the navigation bar that best 
	  	fit with the theme of my website, I tried multiple designs and constantly revised my CSS until one finally connected 
	  	with my design vision. This way, I felt confident I was making the best decisions while also learning many more HTML 
	  	and CSS techniques than I would have otherwise.</br></br>
	Another strategy for revision that I took advantage of was peer reviewing. One highlight of our course for me was the ability
	to improve upon our projects in class and speak to our classmates about our work. I took advantage of this valuable time in 
	many ways. First, I was able to show my website to multiple people in a low-stress environment, and I received honest feedback
	in return. When testing my website, I lacked an accurate opinion since I already knew the ins and outs of my design. Getting a
	third-party to use my website allowed me to analyze its usability much more precisely. In addition, I was able to quickly ask 
	my peers for advice and improve my work much faster than if I was working alone. In the same way, I was also able to provide 
	help and suggestions to others, which only served to strengthen my skills and inspire me further. Peer reviewing was a critical
	part of my revision process and I made sure to take full advantage of the learning environment our course provided me with.</br></br>
	Furthermore, progressing through our Composing Digital Media course really reinforced the importance of my writing skills. 
	This was self-explanatory for the writing assignments, but still proved to be true in all aspects of my final submission. 
	In web design, it is extremely critical to write without making glaring mistakes in spelling and grammar. These issues are 
	noticeable and informal for the website and can completely destroy the functionality of HTML and CSS. Such a simple mistake 
	can make the audience disinterested and mistrusting of your work. Similarly, if a website has too much words for its purpose,
	and the writing is not interesting and engaging, it will not be able to retain its audience. By building my website, I was able
	to improve my writing skills and realize the importance of proofreading and revising.</br></br>
	This concept of the importance of writing skills was reinforced even further as we began working with Photoshop and Audacity. 
	First of all, word choice played a large role in the effectiveness of our movie genre remix posters. I transformed a horror 
	movie into a romantic comedy, and one of the major changes I made was in the title. The original title, <i>Freddy vs. Jason</i>,
	was confrontational and implied violence between the two characters. My new title, <i>When Freddy Met Jason</i>, changes the 
	tone to be more casual and friendly. Furthermore, both the expectations and storyboard assignments required solid creative
	writing to make the final products seem as genuine as possible. The goal of the projects was to create an authentic 
	advertisement and a storyboard that could realistically be used for an actual documentary, so the writing was essential
	to their success.</br></br>
	In addition, even if the actual assignment did not require any writing, I had to be able to present them on my website as
	powerfully and engagingly as possible. For example, the wordmark Photoshop assignment and all of the Audacity projects did 
	not contain much writing, but I needed to provide background and descriptions to make them relevant and keep my audience 
	interested. Especially in the case of audio files, which provide no visual stimulation on their own, my writing was
	essential in fitting them into my website and completing the projects to the best of my ability. In this way, my writing 
	skills were extremely important to all aspects of this course, and I am confident that I grew as a writer as a result.</br></br>
	Finally, the assignments in this course taught me to strongly consider my audience in each and every piece of creative work I 
	submit. I learned that it is not only good enough to complete a project that satisfied my interests, but to cater to the 
	needs of others. This was especially relevant in building my website and creating the most accessible and usable product 
	for my audience. Following the many design principles and frameworks we studied in class, I was able to use strategies such 
	as constraints, conventions, mappings, and the guidelines for incorporating accessibility to produce the most effective 
	website as possible. I believe my final product is inclusive and easy to use, and I learned many valuable lessons that 
	will increase the quality of my work moving forward.</br></br>
	In conclusion, the variety of projects which I completed in this course were extremely helpful in allowing me to grow as a 
	creative writer, and I strengthened my revision, decision-making, and editing processes as a result. I am proud of the work 
	I completed in this semester and look forward to continuing to apply everything I learned.</br></br></p>
