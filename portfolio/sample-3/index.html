      	<p>In my logo/wordmark assignment, I made various decisions concerning color, fonts, and other aspects of the visual mode. 
		To begin with, I chose a font that is easy to read, because my company is a restaurant that caters to all people. 
		I still wanted it to stand out, so I chose a font that had some style and uniqueness to it. This way, people can 
		recognize the font and associate it with my business. Next, I chose to use warm colors such as red, orange, and yellow,
		because these colors are commonly associated with food. Studies also show that these colors incite a feeling of 
		hunger in people. For example, popular restaurants such as Applebee’s. Chili’s, Ruby Tuesday, Wendy’s, McDonald’s, 
		and others all take advantage of these colors, so I chose to as well.</br></br>
	  	If I were creating a logo or watermark for a company that was not a restaurant, I would focus more on the symbolism 
	  	of my design rather than the fonts and colors. I could use a design that does not need words, and people should still 
	  	be able to associate my logo with my company based on the symbolism alone.</br></br<</p>
