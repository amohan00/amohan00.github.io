	<p>I was very proud of all of the work I completed in this course, particularly the soundscape, movie genre remix, wordmark, 
		and overall website design. But I would like to focus specifically on my Pecha Kucha presentation, which I was 
		extremely satisfied with.</br></br>
		To begin with, I researched the design principle of constraint, which I was able to use successfully in various places
	  	of my website. In the actual construction of my presentation, I used a color scheme that was accessible to my users and
	  	matched the design of my website. I also made sure that my slides were not too text heavy, and I made good use of 
	  	pictures to illustrate my points. If I could improve my work further, I would add even more images because the pictures 
	  	I chose to use were so effective. Finally, I believe that the actual delivery of my presentation was well done, and I 
	  	am proud of the way I was able to embed my slides on my website. Overall, I was very satisfied with my completion of 
	  	the Pecha Kucha assignment.</br></br></p>
