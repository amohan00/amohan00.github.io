        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Arun Mohan, and I am a Digital Narrative and Interactive Design major at the University of Pittsburgh.
           I am a senior, and expect to graduate in December 2020 with a Computer Science minor as well.
           My passion for interactive media and technology began early, as my father spent his entire career in the computer science
           field and introduced me to his work. I fell in love with computer programming because I get so much satisfaction from 
           problem solving. I also like being able to teach myself new coding languages and other challenging concepts from the material
           that is available online. After I graduate, I look forward to exploring everything the programming field has to offer.</br></br>
           Beyond school, I enjoy spending time with my parents, older brother, and dog. My hobbies include watching sports with
           friends, and I am an extremely passionate fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers football team and Liverpool, a British soccer team.
           When the weather is nice, I love to get outside and play soccer and basketball as often as I can. Sports have brought me 
           closer to friends and provided me with plenty of exercise, so I hope that they always stay an important part of my life.
