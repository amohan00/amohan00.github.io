        <p>For the first work-in-progress submission, I was responsible for building a basic website structure with multiple links, 
           primarily to display my work in this course. I used a solid understanding of HTML elements, coupled with a basic knowledge 
           of CSS, to flesh out my website and create an immersive and straightforward experience for its users. In this essay, I will 
           be describing my approach to this assignment, including my design vision. I will also be discussing the direction I would like 
           to take my work in order to improve it for the next submission.</br></br>
           To begin with, my design vision was initially very simple; I was looking to create a website that internet users would be 
           inclined to use. When I am browsing the internet and come across a website that does not immediately appeal to me, I usually 
           do not waste time on the site. There are often millions of other web pages that contain the same information that I am looking 
           for, so I am usually quick to back out and look for another website that is more appealing to me. Similarly, when people click 
           on the link to my website, my goal is to keep them on my page for as long as possible so that I can convey all of the 
           information that it contains.</br></br>
           I believe this is best accomplished by simplicity. Firstly, the navigation of the website should be clearly labelled and easy
           to find. If it is not obvious how to find the next pages on the website, then people will not get a chance to see them. 
           Also, if people click on a link expecting to see a certain page, and I show them something different, then their experience 
           becomes negative and they are likely to leave. This is why a clear and convenient navigation bar is a key element to any 
           website and was one of the main focuses to my design concept. I made the decision to place my navigation at the very top of 
           the page so that it is the first thing users see.</br></br>
           Secondly, the text and color scheme play a large role in simplicity. My goal is to convey the information on my website in 
           the form of written text. Therefore, it was important for me to pick text and background colors that compliment each other 
           and make the words on the page easier to read. Similarly, I decided to use calmer colors such as grey and green throughout 
           my site because bright and colorful background colors can be extremely distracting from the important content. I especially 
           disagreed with the use of a background image because they can make a page feel cluttered or distracting as well. Finally, I 
           felt that by keeping my text formatting consistent throughout my website, I was simplifying the website so that my users 
           would know what to expect on every page. By removing any unwelcome surprises, I felt like I was more likely to keep people 
           on my website for longer and provide them with a positive experience.</br></br>
           In order to achieve this simplicity and ease-of-use that I was striving for, I also looked online to currently published 
           websites for guidance. One of my inspirations was Wikipedia, an open source online encyclopedia used by millions. While 
           their site contains much more text and information than mine, I was impressed by its organization and clearness. Each 
           section of text was clearly labelled and accurately described to the reader what they would be reading. There is also an 
           extremely easy to use navigation bar at the top and side of the page. Finally, their plain white background serves its 
           purpose of emphasizing the written text, and their use of pictures was simple and relevant. I believe that all of these 
           things make Wikipedia one of the most frequently used online resources, and I was hoping to replicate their strategy in 
           my approach.</br></br>
           In addition, revisioning was a key component to creating my website. While these components I previously mentioned sound 
           fine, I did not know how effective they were for my purposes until I actually implemented the elements and viewed the site. 
           One of the benefits of using GitHub pages for this assignment was that I was able to frequently commit changes and rebuild 
           the site. For every display and styling element I chose to add, I made sure that they reacted with my content in the way 
           that I intended before continuing. For example, the background of my website was initially dark green. After adding the 
           navigation, I determined that the text color that worked best for the hyperlinks was blue since that is what people are
           most familiar with. But, after implementing both features, I found that my navigation was very difficult to read, and so I 
           revised my design and change my background color to light grey. This was an important step in creating a successful and 
           immersive website for my users.</br></br>
           Finally, although I am proud of my completed submission, I recognize that there are areas in which I need to improve. 
           To begin with, I found it difficult to grasp the spatial formatting concepts in HTML and CSS. On all of my pages, the 
           information is simply vertical and reads from top to bottom. I attempted to arrange things differently on the page, from 
           left to right, but my formatting frequently messed up the spacing, padding, and margins. In addition, I am looking forward 
           to improving my Photoshopping skills. I am currently self-taught, but I know I can benefit greatly from a structured lesson.
           These photo editing concepts can also be applied to my web design, since ideas such as color, white space, and perspective 
           are extremely important in both areas.</br></br>
           In conclusion, I believe the simplicity and attention to detail my website boasts make it successful and immersive for the 
           user, and while I am proud of it, it is a work-in-progress that I look forward to improving.</br></br></p>
