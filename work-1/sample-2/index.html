        <p></br>In my opinion, an engaging website is one that looks neat and organized. If I am browsing the internet and come across 
                a site that looks jumbled and messy, I am usually pretty quick to back out and look for a more reliable source, and less 
                likely to engage with the material. In addition, the website should be aesthetically pleasing and go by a set color theme 
                and arrangement on each of its pages. This is also what makes a website easy to use in my opinion. If the page is 
                well-organized and has clear arrangements and labels on each page, then I am more likely to use it successfully. Finally, 
                I believe what makes a website impressive or memorable is its incorporation of pictures and other multimedia components. 
                I think that a website with just text elements is boring and can be like reading a long instruction manual. When you are 
                able to add pictures to your site that are actually relevant and interesting, it makes the entire website more impressive 
                and exciting.</br></br>
                These ideas are the main focus for me as I develop my Github pages website. So far, I had the idea of using darker and 
                calmer color schemes, such as blue or green, to add some excitement but not distract from the main content of my web 
                pages. I also think navigation is extremely important to making the site engaging, aesthetically pleasing, and easy to 
                use, so I want my navigation bar at the top of the page and clearly labelled. I have also considered adding a smaller 
                navigation at the bottom of the page so users can scroll through the entire page and still have their navigation 
                options. My main goal is simplicity in my layout and added excitement with images and illustrations along with my text. 
                I think a background image can often be too distracting or make a page feel too cluttered, so I want to instead add a 
                variety of images throughout the website. A similar design that I have seen online is that of Wikipedia. I wonâ€™t have 
                as much text in my website, but the simplicity of its layout and use of pictures has always made Wikipedia engaging 
                and easy to use. </p>
